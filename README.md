The State-of-the-Art Greenhouse |  The ReadMe.md üìñ
```

Our project, **The Greenhouse**, is a cool, state-of-the-art system we built to manage greenhouses efficiently. Created and maintained by Bhanuka Bandara, Ruvindi Jayasooriya, Muditha Pasan, Yashara Wanigasekara, Safak Ahamed, and Sandini Imesha, this was our **1st Year 1st Semester Group Project** at university. We took it pretty seriously, treating it like a competition. Not only did we create an Arduino-based greenhouse project, but we also developed a pixel-perfect mobile app with cutting-edge AI tech.

The project has been discontinued and publicly archived, but as they say, **'every cloud has a silver lining.'** Although this will remain archived, a new derivative of this project is coming soon. It will be especially useful for you as a university student, **so stay tuned for a surprise.** Also, feel free to use this project for your own use cases.
