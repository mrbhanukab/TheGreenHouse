The State-of-the-Art Greenhouse |  The ReadMe.md ðŸ“–
```

Our project, **The Greenhouse**, is a cool, state-of-the-art system we built to manage greenhouses efficiently. Created and maintained by Bhanuka Bandara, Ruvindi Jayasooriya, Muditha Pasan, Yashara Wanigasekara, Safak Ahamed, and Sandini Imesha, this was our **1st Year 1st Semester Group Project** at university. We took it pretty seriously, treating it like a competition. Not only did we create an Arduino-based greenhouse project, but we also developed a pixel-perfect mobile app with cutting-edge AI tech.

### Preparing Proposal Presentation

### Proposal Presentation
<table>
<tr>
<td>To sum it up, it went perfectly! Even better than we expected. Everyone was listening intently, with big smiles on their faces. The marking lecturers even said, "Compared to final-year projects, superb!" That says it all. ðŸ˜Š</td>

### Development Stage
Honestly, this stage was a headache! Our project was much more complicated than the others, so it gave us a lot of trouble. Letâ€™s not even go into the details here, but trust me, it was stressful.

### Final Exhibition

<td>To be honest, the final exhibition didnâ€™t go exactly as we hoped. We managed to finish about 97% of the project because we ran into some time issues. But hey, we still made it through, and thatâ€™s a win in our books! ðŸ¥³</td>

### Top List
Good news! We were selected as top finalists, and we got the opportunity to showcase our skills to the management of the Faculty of Computing. They were amazed by our project, especially because we are in our first year, first semester.

## Features

- Manage an **unlimited number of plants individually**
- **Fully automated** plant watering system for each plant
- **Automatic environmental control** (temperature and humidity)
- **Real-time** data monitoring
- Advanced **security system**
- Beautiful and simple **cross-platform mobile app**
- **AI integration** for intelligent decision-making
- And many more fancy features!

---

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: We used Flutter, an open-source UI software development kit created by Google, to build the mobile app. It allowed us to develop a cross-platform app that runs smoothly on both Android and iOS devices, offering a consistent user experience.

- **Arduino**: Arduino was the backbone of our greenhouse sensor management. It helped us control the various sensors and systems in the greenhouse, like temperature, humidity, and plant watering, ensuring everything worked automatically and efficiently.

## Mobile App Preview
> This is not a snapshot of the latest design â€” unfortunately, I didn't take any screenshots of it or release the build. But you can still build it yourself if you want. The previous version (shown below) is mobile-responsive, but the latest version isn't â€” it's all about looks, you know, like how girls are with their makeup ðŸ« .

## Optimizations & Features You Can Contribute

We had to stop working on this project due to time constraints (university life, you know!), and weâ€™re not maintaining it either. But hey, this is where you come in! Thereâ€™s still plenty you can add:

- Complete the **individual plant-to-main board communication** feature.  
- Integrate AI in a properly usable way, instead of just saying "This contains AI."  
- Use Redis as the database.  
- Reduce complexity and optimize.  
- Honestly, the skyâ€™s the limit â€” be the next Steve Jobs and take this project to the next level!
