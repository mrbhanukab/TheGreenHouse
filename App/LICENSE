materials (such as YouTube videos, books, or online courses), you are required to modify at least 25% of the
"theGreenHouse" materials. This modification ensures that your academic work demonstrates your understanding
and application of the concepts presented in "theGreenHouse," rather than simply relying on our pre-built
